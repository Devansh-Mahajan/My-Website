Transforming a nice, short little geometry question into a ravening monster of an equation by textbook coordinate geometry does not have the same taste of victory as a two-line vector solution

**Proof.** Call the triangle $ABC$. Now let $P$ be the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $AB$ and $AC$.
Because $P$ is on the $AB$ bisector, $|AP|=|PB|$.
Because $P$ is on the $AC$ bisector, $|AP|=|PC|$.
Combining the two, $|BP|=|PC|$.
But this means that $P$ has to be on the $BC$ bisector.
Hence all three bisectors are concurrent.

(Incidentally, $P$ is the circumcentre of $\triangle ABC$.)                                                                           $\Box$

**Understand the problem**
   - "Show that..." or "Evaluate..." questions in which a certain statement has to be proven true, or a certain expression has to be worked out
   - "Find a..." or "Find all..." questions, which requires one to find something (or everything) that satisfies certain requirements
