Recently came across this book by Terence Tao probably THE math genius of our time and couldnt pass up the oppurtunity to see and understand maths and problem solving strategies from his POV. I will be summarizing his content and also add my solution to his problems.

**Chapters:**
- [[Strategies in problem solving]]
- [[Examples in number Theory]]
- [[Examples in algebra and analysis]]
- [[Euclidian geometry]]
- [[Analytic geometry]]
- [[Sundry examples]]
