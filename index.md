# Welcome to My Digital Garden 🌱

Hi! I'm **Devansh Mahajan**, a student of **Electronics and Computer Science (EECS)** at **ETH Zürich**.  

This blog is my way of sharing the study journey with others, especially fellow ETH students. It’s an evolving digital knowledge base where I connect insights from coursework, research, and projects — bridging rigorous theory with practical application.  

Before we get into the actual study notes, I want to pause on something important. ETH is tough — and that’s exactly why it has the reputation it does. The workload is heavy, and imposter syndrome is everywhere. It’s easy to look around and feel like everyone else is a natural. But once you’re here, you already have what it takes. What matters is to keep at it. 

One passage that helps me put this into perspective comes from *Outliers*:  

> [!quote]  
> *“The striking thing about Ericsson’s study is that he and his colleagues couldn’t find any ‘naturals,’ musicians who floated effortlessly to the top while practicing a fraction of the time their peers did. Nor could they find any ‘grinds,’ people who worked harder than everyone else, yet just didn’t have what it takes to break the top ranks. Their research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That’s it. And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder. The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again in Ericsson’s research.”*  
> — *Malcolm Gladwell, Outliers*  

This is why it’s so important to stay consistent. The people who claim they don’t study much, or who seem effortlessly gifted, usually either studied the material before (their head start fades quickly) or aren’t telling the whole truth. Don’t let that discourage you. If someone looks talented, treat it as a milestone to aim for the only real difference is that they’ve already put in the hours.  

Remember this quote when things get overwhelming, and keep working. ETH is hard but it’s also a place where hard work is rewarded very, very much.  
# 🎯 Areas of Focus

## [[200 ETH Zurich/ETH BSc EECS - Overview|ETH Zurich]]
Notes and reflections from my ETH journey spanning electronics, computer systems, algorithms, data structures and applied mathematics. 

The goal is not just to summarise lectures but also to include additional literature whenever needed to deepen understanding of the concepts.
## IMO + Putnam
Exploring mathematical concepts through IMO and Putnam problem-solving, including advanced topics in algebra, geometry, and number theory.

## Quantitative Analysis
Exploring quantitative models in computing and finance — from probability theory and statistics to algorithmic trading foundations.

## Projects
A portfolio of hands-on experiments and builds: embedded systems, software engineering, algorithm design, and interdisciplinary projects.

## Books
Structured notes and reviews from books across technology, mathematics, engineering, and personal growth.
